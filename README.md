# React hooks to do application

This is based on this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxK8b99iJTg), which is in turn based on this [article tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-react-to-do-app-with-react-hooks-no-class-components).

## How I did it

Started by running
```
npm i -S react@16.7.0-alpha.2 react-dom@16.7.0-alpha.2
```
